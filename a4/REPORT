- What was the process you used to complete the assignment. That is, how did you organize
  your work, go about understanding the starter code, and build a solution.
  
  We splitted the work based on features. We used the concept from lecture 8 and ray tracing tutorials
  to implement the features.
  
- Brief description of the code you implemented and how it works. Particularly if you did anything 
  that is not straightforward to understand by looking at your code.
  
  Soft shadow, glossy reflection, and anti-aliasing are implemented based on the psudocode from tutorial slides.
  Texture mapping and refraction are implemented based on the formula we learned in lecture 7 and 8.

- What parts of the assignment were easy/hard.

  The hardest part of this assignment is to render scene. Too many memory allocation could cause segmentation fault.

- Whether the assignment helped you understand better the following topics:
  - Geometry (points, vectors, planes, spheres, intersections, normals, etc.)
	YES.
  - Object transformations
	YES.
  - Projection and coordinate frames
	YES.
  - Illumination (the Phong model, basically)
	YES.
  
- The role of each member on the project:
Yijin Wang: Refraction, anti-aliasing
Wei Jun Zeng: Soft shadow, texture mapping
Together: glossy reflection
(Both members were involved in debugging.)

- Note:
	- We couldn't render anti-aliasing for our final scene due to not enough memory.
	Therefore, we decided to have the final scene without anti-aliasing, and another image
	especially shows anti-aliasing effect.
